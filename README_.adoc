== Problem to solve

My previous project https://forum.katalon.com/t/visual-inspection-in-katalon-studio-reborn/57440["Visual Inspection in Katalon Studio -- Reborn"] enabled to me to compare pages of a web site. It produces diff information of HTML source files. The HTML diff info helps me understanding the causes of the visual differences in the screenshot PNG images between 2 environment --- the Production env and the Development env.

Half year has passed since I released the "Visual Inspection" project, I realized that HTML is not enough. Any web app consists of mainly 3 types of web resources: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS). I want to see **the source of CSS and JavaScripts** that are referred by the web pages. And I want to see the diff information of CSS and JS as well.

Let me tell you another story. Any web application depend on some external software products. For example, my application depends on https://jquery.com/[jQuery] and https://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap]. Once your web application is released for the production use, any new releases of the external dependencies will put continuous pressure on you. You have to upgrade them sometime in near future. However it is a scary task. Why? --- You are scared that some changes in the external dependencies may affect your web pages but you can not predict what will happen. Therefore all you can do is _to look at as many pages of your web app as possible looking for anything unusual_. I call this tiresome and boring activity as *"Visual Inspection"*. My "Visual Inspection" approach can automate it. However, jQuery and Bootstrap --- these are really a collection of CSS and JS files. When I find something to investigate, I would need to look at the CSS & JS sources. So **I want to see the diff info of CSS and JS of jQuery & Bootstrap before/after the upgrade. Is it possible?**

== Solution

This project "Visual Inspection of CSS and JS" contains a demonstration link:Scripts/MyAdmin/MyAdmin_visual_inspection_twins/Script1643034427943.groovy[Test Cases/MyAdmin/MyAdmin_visual_inspection_twins] that compares 2 URLs:

* http://myadmin.kazurayam.com 
* http://devadmin.kazurayam.com

It scrapes all the sources of HTML, CSS, JavaScript refered by the pages. The Test Case uses the [Chrome DevTools Protocol, Network Domain](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Network/) in order to recognize the URLs of resources refered by the page. The Test Case saves the files, associate files as pairs, make diff, and compile a report in HTML. A sample output is here:

- https://kazurayam.github.io/VisualInspectionOfCssAndJs/demo/MyAdmin_visual_inspection_twins-index.html[Demo report]

This sample report includes diff info of CSS and JS files distributed by jQuery and Bootstrap. For example, see the following link:

- https://kazurayam.github.io/VisualInspectionOfCssAndJs/demo/MyAdmin_visual_inspection_twins/20220126_220156/objects/4c2502854bbc5defa960ad2604c46b46c709eb40.html[diff of bootstrap-icons CSS, v1.5.0 vs v1.7.2]

image::https://kazurayam.github.io/VisualInspectionOfCssAndJs/images/bootstrap-icons.png[diff of bootstrap-icons CSS]

Please note that this link shows the difference of 2 different versions of a single product. v1.5.0 and v1.7.2 of the https://icons.getbootstrap.com/[bootstrap-icons] project. Please imagine that now I am going to upgrade my web app from v1.5.0 to v1.7.2. With this diff info, I would be sure if this upgrade would affect my web app or not.

== Description

=== How to run the demo

Chrome DevTools Protocol is a new technology. Katalon Studio does not support it out of box. I needed to setup the project with external jar files. Consequently I have got 2 options.

In both options, you just want open and run link:Scripts/MyAdmin/MyAdmin_visual_inspection_twins/Script1643034427943.groovy[Test Cases/MyAdmin/MyAdmin_visual_inspection_twins]. The script takes approximately 30 seconds to finish. It will make a report in the `<projectDir>/store` directory.

==== Option1: Using kklisura's CDP library

- Katalon Studio version: Any version, e.g, v8.2.0
- will use https://github.com/kklisura/chrome-devtools-java-client[GitHub kklisura
/
chrome-devtools-java-client], which is bundled in the `Drivers` directory
- set the `GlobalVarible.visitSite_by_Selenium4_CDT` in the Execution Profile `default` with value of *false*.


==== Option2: Using Selenium 4

- Katalon Studio version: [v8.2.1 alpha](https://forum.katalon.com/t/studio-8-2-1-alpha-is-now-available-with-selenium-4/61011/3) is required
- will use https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-devtools-v96[selenium-devtools-v96], which is bundled in the `Drivers` directory
- set the `GlobalVarible.visitSite_by_Selenium4_CDT` in the Execution Profile `default` with value of *true*.


=== How the test script is designed


I have updated the https://github.com/kazurayam/materialstore[materialstore] library to v0.1.10. With it my
